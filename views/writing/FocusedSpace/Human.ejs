<%- include('../../partials/section', {page: 'Human',title: 'Forms',section: '<h4>Human</h4>\nHumans are a carbon based biological race. Hopefully you know enough about humans that I dont need to describe them. Natural born humans still exist. There was a movement to prevent augmented humans from eradicating the standard Human template. Now natural humans live in colonies devoted to preventing them from having direct contact with augmented humans. These colonies have technologies that do enhance the capabilities of these humans but they are all designed to do so non invasivly.\n<h4>Evos</h4>\nEvos are humans that have modified themselves in some way. This can be through mechanical implants or genetic modification. The method doesnt matter as long a modification has happened then that person is an evo.\n<h4>Ivos</h4>\nIn the late 23rd century with the rise of Evos there became a problem where Evos began to infultrate natural human settlements because of the advantage that they recived when competing with natural humans. Because of this rather than eradicating the evos that broke this rule the human settlements governments created a method of registering exactly what augmentations of each Evo and what they are capable of. These registered evos were rebranded as Integrated Evos or Ivos for short.\n<h4>Androids</h4>\nAt first the word Android was used to refer to artifical human like robots but the word now referes to any artifical system with human level intelegence. Androids now exist everywhere in human society. Androids are highly regulated to prevent them from becoming a threat.\n<h4>Small talkers</h4>\nNamed after the computer language small talk. Small talkers are any artifical intelegence not designed or built by a human. If an android was to construct another android or if one was to form spontaniously from other non sentient systems the resulting artifical intelegence would be branded a small talker. Small talkers are illegal anywhere in the civilized sections of human societies and are hunted down.'}); -%>

<%- include('../../partials/section', {page: 'Human',title: 'History',section: "<h4>Past</h4>\nJust to mention I want the past of humanity in this setting to be our past. I'm not going for an alternate history. I started writing this sci-fi setting in 2022 so this will be the deviation point where the fiction starts. Enevatibly as time moves forward this will turn into an alternate history. I'm ok with having to accept that enevatbility.\n<h4>Begining of the Sci-Fi</h4>\n<h4>Discovery of FTL</h4>\n2340 travel ftl is discovered and the first ftl ship is tested in 2344. 2375 Blink ftl is discovered\n<h4>Blink Day</h4>\nOn 3054 May 16 the 4th expidationary fleet attempting to blink to a new system and dissapears. Other ships in human space atempting to blink also dissapear. Blink drive is swiftly restricted. Sientists discover that the quantum fiz has changed causing blink drive to be less stable.\n<h4>First Contact</h4>\nOn 3184 a large fleet of ships made of wood appears in the tau ceti system then began to converge on sol at travel ftl. The fleet is a null-beta fleet of ships. Humanity deploys the fleet defending sol to intercept the incoming alien fleet and there is a stand off at the edge of the system for several years. Many attempts to communicate were made but the null-beta are a speceis that are incapable of any kind of communication. They dont even have a concept of communication. One year into the stand off the null-beta fleet is able to secure a ice comet to refule their fleet and they blinked away.\n<h4>Seccond Contact</h4>\nOn 3221 a fleet of ships blinked into the Ross 248 system. That fleet remained in that system for five years atempting to communicate. After four years of waiting the aliens were able to translate human language and began communicating. They introduced themselves as the Youreen. After communicating for a year that they were not hostile they were invited by humanity to move to sol and were given an abandoned colony in the asteroid belt to act as a home base. The Youreen complied.\n</br>\nThe Youreen were organized under the navigators guild but found that they needed to adapt to working with humans and thus split off a new guild called the nogotiators guild. This new guild would act as leasons to the humans.\n</br>\nThe navigators guild voted that they want to return to Youreen space to bring back the news that humans could be a valuble ally where the nogociators guild decided that they wanted to integrate with the humans in the hopes of merging their two cultures for cooperation.\n</br>\nOver time the nogotiators guild became so good at negiciating that they negociated an embacy on earth and a few other locations in the solar system. The Youreen developed a reputation that they are very shrewd negociators. There was some grumbling from some human officals that the Youreen were negociating for too much too quickly. These grumbling made their way to the Youreen and because of this new factions started to form in the youreen social structure. The original faction the youreen in the fleet were a part of was the Guild Purists. The Guild Purists beleived that Guilds should only exist if they dont hurt any youreen. What changed in the Youreen in the vanguard fleet is that some youreen felt that humanity could be considered part of the youreen society and thus if the negociators guild was causing distress amongs the humans then maybe the negociators guild shouldnt exist.\n</br>\nThe Youreen split into two new factions. The Xeno Purists beleived that Guilds shouldn't exist if they hurt humans and thus the negociators guild should be dispanded. Most of the navigators guild became Xeno Purists. The other faction was the Xeno Supremisists. They beleived that Humans shouldnt be thought as part of Youreen society and thus Guilds could do anything to humans as long as it benifits the youreen.\n</br>\nThese factions eventually went to war. This war was a very dirty single minded war. Alot of humans were caught up in the cross fire.\n</br>\nRather than have the war carry on for long the government of earth sat down with the negociators guild and negociated a full withdrawel from human space. Using the damage that the youreen war had on humanity as leverage such a withdrawel was successfuly negociated. The youreen spent a year getting all their material togeather and then left without communicating.\n<h4>Third Contact</h4>\nOn zzzz a fleet of alien ships appear near the proxima centari system.\n<h4>The age of stellar relations</h4>"}); -%>
